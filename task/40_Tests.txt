* Description

    Create a automated test using Test::More

    Use code/common.pl to connect to DB
    Tests go into "code/t/"
    Test file extention is ".t"
    The test execution order is determined by the test file name
    ex:
        001_test_one.t
        002_test_two.t
        ...

* Things to test/ use
#   create a valid plan
#       See Test::More 'tests' => NUMBER;
#       and
#       plan 'tests' => NUMBER;  # for dynamic tests
#
#   Do we have a valid connection object
#   Do we have the correct number of rows in each table
#
#   Conditional block test with SKIP 
#       Ex: if there is a delegate with the name "J. Jonah Jameson"
#               there must never be another with the name "spiderman"
#               (fail in this case)
#          Run the test without this special delegate
#           Insert him
#          Run the test again
#
#   ...
