    * This script must run in perl 5.8

    * Write a script that receives a variable number of arguments
        + For all the arguments received:
            If the argument is a number and odd
                put it into an array called "odd"
            If the argument is a number and even
                put it into an array called "even"
            If the argument has a sub-string 'nan' 
                put it into an array called "banana_candidate"
            otherwise, place the argument into and array called "other"

        + Cycle all the arrays, use a hash to count the number of  times
          a argument is given

        + Print all the arrays and hash to STDOUT

        + Print all the arrays and hash to a file named output.txt

    * Knowledge used:
        Script Basics
        Variables
            Scalar
            Array
            Hash
        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use Data::Dumper;
        regular expressions

    * Example:
        perl anylise_arguments.pl 1 2 1 23 345 hello one 34 3 456 90011uu 23 lanana

        @odd =  (1,1,23,3, 23);
        @even = (2,34,456);
        @banana_candidate = ('lanana');
        @other = qw(hello one 90011uu);
        %count_hash = (
            '1'       => 2,
            '23'      => 2,
            '3'       => 1,
            '23'      => 1,
            '2'       => 1,
            '34'      => 1,
            '456'     => 1,
            'hello'   => 1,
            'one'     => 1,
            '90011uu' => 1,
            'lanana'  => 1,
        );
